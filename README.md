3. I chose to do a Quiz Game due to my love for Anime. In this game you have the choice of two categories in which you select either On Piece Questions or Pokemon Questions! With either category you have 5 questions that go from easy to hard and if you get 4 out of 5 questions correct you are considered a Winner! If you get less then 4 questions correct out of the 5 you are given the Lost message and are able to select Try Again to redo the quiz or slect the second category.

For future enchacements I would have made the Question/Option Container Transparent, along with adding more questions/true and false questions. Given the life events that I am currently expereincing truly happy with the outcome I was able to create.
